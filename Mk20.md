# Install a klh10 / PDP-10 DECSYSTEM-20 Running TOPS-20 Panda on a Raspberry Pi or Apple Mac OSX with TCP/IP Service Between Them

These are step-by-step instructions to install an emulator for the DECSYSTEM-2060 computer onto a Raspberry Pi running Trixie, install and configure its TOPS-20 operating system, and establish TCP/IP Telnet and FTP communications between the DEC20 and the Raspberry Pi.  The information and tools to do this are readily available from public sources: this guide simply integrates that information into one document.

Though these instructions were developed on the Raspberry Pi, **the procedure works for Apple Macintosh OSX (Sierra, at least), as well.**  

On the Raspberry Pi, booting the DEC20 breaks the Pi's external network connections.  That doesn't happen with OSX: the Mac's networking connections to the rest of the world continue to function.

Following this guide, you will:

* Install a DECSYSTEM-2060 emulator onto a Raspberry Pi or Apple Macintosh
* Install a TOPS-20 operating system for that emulated computer
* Install software, documentation, and magtape libraries to support that DECSYSTEM-20
* Establish TCP/IP connectivity between the Raspberry Pi and the DECSYSTEM-2060 it is hosting.


## Tools Needed

1. A Raspberry Pi (preferably something between a Pi-3 and a Pi-5) with appropriate power supply, keyboard, mouse/trackpad, display, and at least 1GB of available storage capacity. 
1. Internet connection for that Pi.

## Working Assumptions

This guide provides links to software and documentation libraries and details on the installation but does not attempt to provide guidance on the use or management of TOPS-20.  The various reference manuals provide that information.

Nor does this guide provide any information on managing the Raspberry Pi: it assumes that you're comfortable working in the Linux environment and using the Pi commands and tools.

While this installation would likely work on earlier versions of the Raspberry Pi (Debian) operating system, this guide assumes that you have a fresh installation of RPi Trixie.  Creation of this guide was motivated by an installation of the DEC20 on an earlier, migrated version of RPi OS in which the TCP/IP connection simply could not be made to function.  The problem was resolved with a clean install of the DEC20 onto a Raspberry Pi running a clean install of Trixie.

> [!NOTE]
> **This guide assumes that you have a fresh install of Trixie on your Raspberry Pi.**

## Setting Up

1. Install Trixie on your Raspberry Pi
2. Make sure your software is up to date:
	* $ sudo apt-get update
	* $ sudo apt-get full-upgrade
	* [$ sudo reboot if updates were performed]
3. Choose a hostname for the emulated DEC20 you'll be creating.  I chose 'dec20'.
3. Choose a unique IP address for your emulated DEC20.  My network is 192.168.1.x; I chose 192.168.1.60 for 'dec20' and made sure it didn't conflict with any other host on my net.

I use my router's DHCP service to assign specific IP addresses to each of my connected hosts, and each of my hosts has a `/etc/hosts` file that lists all hosts and their IP addresses.  You'll likely need to modify the following to your setup, perhaps just adding your DEC20's hostname and IP address to `/etc/hosts` on the Pi that you're installing your DEC20 onto.

Don't edit the network connections on your Pi from the initial installation except to modify the `/etc/hosts` file to add your DEC20 host IP address. The Pi networking environment should have devices lo, eth0, and wlan0.  Ensure that after booting the Pi, Internet addresses have been assigned to eth0 and wlan0 and that both network connections are functioning.  For example,
<sub>
```
	hdtodd@pi-5:~ $ ip -c address 
	 
	1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
	    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
	    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
	       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
	    inet6 ::1/128 scope host noprefixroute 
	       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
	2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
	    link/ether 2c:cf:67:ad:c9:b9 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
	    inet 192.168.1.88/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
	       valid_lft 75238sec preferred_lft 75238sec
	    inet6 fe80::c953:95e9:baf2:6a3a/64 scope link noprefixroute 
	       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
	3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
	    link/ether 2c:cf:67:ad:c9:bb brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
	    inet 192.168.1.89/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlan0
	       valid_lft 75243sec preferred_lft 75243sec
	    inet6 fe80::5018:b779:1c7a:15a3/64 scope link noprefixroute 
	       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

## Prepare the Pi to Compile and Host the DEC20

TOPS-20 only supports Telnet and FTP, which aren't up to modern security standards and don't come installed on the Pi.  We'll need to install those tools on the Pi manually in order to connect to the DEC20 when we have it running.  We'll install both Telnet and FTP on the Pi so that it can connect _into_ the hosted DEC20, and we'll install vsFTPd on the Pi so that the DEC20 can connect _out_ to the Pi:

* $ sudo apt-get install telnet
* $ sudo apt-get install ftp
* $ sudo apt-get install vsftpd

vsFTPd is added as a system service and so starts automatically.  Confirm that the Pi is offering FTP service via vsFTPd by issuing the command to FTP to itself (where `<hostname>` is the name of your Pi in the IP tables):

* $ ftp \<hostname\>

which should present the vsftpd prompt:
```
	Connected to <hostname>
	220 (vsFTPd 3.0.5)
	Name (<hostname>:<username>):
```
And, finally, we need to install the 'autoconf' package that is used to configure the DEC20 emulator for compilation:

* $ sudo apt-get install autoconf

## Gather the DEC20 Materials You'll Need

We'll need the emulator and associated software, a virtual disk with the TOPS-20 OS, manuals, and magtape images to support the DEC20 installation, so we'll start by collecting those.

Several emulators are available for the PDP-10 processors, but we're going to use Ken Harrenstien's 'klh10' system, and from that system we'll use just the code that emulates the KL10-B processor that was the heart of the DECSYSTEM-2060.  The 'klh10' code has been maintained on a Github site, and that code compiles cleanly on Raspberry Pi Trixie (as of this writing).  

Start by creating a directory that will hold the _source_ materials for the system and its documentation.  For example, in your home directory, you might:

* $ mkdir DEC20Sources; cd DEC20Sources

to create and connect into that directory.  We'll work there to build the emulator and associated software, documentation, and magtape libraries.

Working in that directory, clone Harrenstien's klh10 code:

* $ git clone http://github.com/pdp-10/klh10

The klh10 code is just the emulator.  We still need a systems disk and the TOPS-20 software.  

We'll take the easy route and start with Mark Crispin's Panda package that has the systems disk already created, loaded with applications, and (mostly) configured for use.  That package is located on the Trailing-Edge site,  [Panda TOPS-20 distribution](https://panda.trailing-edge.com/).

So, again while working in your DEC20Sources directory, issue:

* $ wget https://panda.trailing-edge.com/panda-dist.tar.gz
* $ tar -xzf panda-dist.tar.gz

which will create the directory `panda-dist` in your DEC20Sources directory.

You may eventually want to install software from some of the other magtapes in the library (see below), and it's convenient to be able to read those tapes on the Linux side as well as read/create them on the TOPS-20 side.  The "read20" program does that, but MRC's version is outdated.  We'll use an updated version from another github repository:

* $ git clone https://github.com/brouhaha/tapeutils

which creates the `tapeutils` directory in your DEC20Sources directory and loads the program source code.

You'll want to keep a set of TOPS-20 manuals handy for reference, so create a directory for them in DEC20Sources:

* $ mkdir Manuals

The last general release of TOPS-20 was version 7.x, but earlier reference materials -- particularly for Macro, FORTRAN, etc. -- didn't change much.  So reference materials for TOPS v6 or V7 are probably most relevant.  

In your web browser, go to [Zane Healy's site](https://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/decemulation/TOPS-20_notebooks.html) and select and download into your "Manuals" directory the reference materials you think you might need.  That set should at least include:

* [Users Guide](http://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/tops20_7/USERS.pdf)
* [User Utilities](http://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/tops20_7/USER_UTILS.pdf)
* [Commands Reference Manual](http://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/tops20_7/COMMANDS.pdf)
* [Systems Managers Guide](http://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/tops20_7/MGR_GUIDE.pdf)
* [Operator's Guide](http://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/tops20_7/OP_GUIDE.pdf)
* [Operator's Command Language Ref Manual](http://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/tops20_7/OPRCOM.HTML)

Finally, there is a substantial library of magnetic tapes with system software components that can be installed on your DEC20 system.  Most of them are already installed on MRC's Panda distribution, but you may want some of the others.  It's handy to keep them all in one place, so, again start in your "DEC20Sources" directory and:

* $ mkdir Tapes; cd Tapes

In your web browser, go to [the Trailing Edge PDP-10 site](https://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/) and select a few of the tapes for components you think might be useful. In particular, consider downloading the tapes identified as "T20 DOCUMENTATION UPD TAPE 1990": they contain, in text format, the software notebooks that describe system installation and management.  It's easiest to right-click on the "tape image" link associated with a desired tape, copy that link, then in a terminal window connected to the "Tapes" directory, type "wget " and then paste the link URL for the tape.  You'll download a .bz2 file.  Use:

* $bunzip2 -d \<filename\>

to unzip the files.  You could restore the tape contents to your TOPS-20 systems disk with the DUMPER utility, but you'll most likely find it more useful to be able to list (-t) or extract (-x) the tape files on your Raspberry Pi with the Linux "read20" utility we'll build and install with the "klh10" package.

There is also a substantial collection of user-contributed software in the DECUS library, and the Trailing Edge site contains the library of 11 DECUS DEC20 tapes.   [This](https://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/decuslib20-07/01/decus/20-0000/20-library-distribution-notes.mem.html) is an (incomplete) catalog of holdings 1-149 out of 192 items, some of which might be of interest.

## Compiling and Installing the System

### Compiling and Installing klh10
To compile the klh10 emulator, we'll follow a subset of the instructions in `~/DEC20sources/klh10/doc/install.txt`.  When we finish, we'll install the emulator, associated support files, and virtual (Panda) system disk in a production directory.  We'll run that emulator as root, so create that directory,

* $ sudo mkdir /DEC20

(or choose some other directory name and location).

The klh10 system uses KLH10_HOME to point to that directory, so:

* $ KLH10_HOME=/DEC20; export KLH10_HOME

to set that up (**and add that to ~/.profile to avoid having to do it in the future.**)

1. Connect to `DEC20sources/klh10`
2. `$ mkdir tmp; cd tmp`
3. `$ ../autogen.sh --bindir=$KLH10_HOME`
3. `$ make -C bld-kl`
3. `$ sudo make -C bld-kl install`

You've now created and installed the klh10 emulator:
<sub>
```
	$ ls /DEC20
	dpni20  dprpxx  dptm03  enaddr  flushed  kn10-kl  tapedd  udlconv  uexbconv  vdkfmt  wfconv  wxtest
```
</sub>
We'll install the "read20" program there, too:

* $ cd ../../tapeutils
* $ make
* $ sudo cp read20 /DEC20

The other utilities are likely not useful, so we won't clutter /DEC20 with them.

### Installing the TOPS-20 Systems Disk

We have the klh10 emulator installed but now need the TOPS-20 operating system disk.  We'll just use the Panda drive that MRC has left for us.  Most of the files in the `panda-dist` directory are programs compiled for other architectures and so aren't useful here. But the RP07 virtual disk and the .ini and boot files will work just fine on our newly-compiled klh10, so we'll move those files to our /DEC20 directory:

```
	$ cd DEC20Sources/panda-dist
	$ sudo mv boot.sav /DEC20
	$ sudo mv dfkfb.ini /DEC20
	$ sudo mv klt20* /DEC20
	$ sudo mv mtboot.sav /DEC20
	$ sudo mv README* /DEC20
	$ sudo mv RH20.RP07.1 /DEC20
	$ sudo chown root:root /DEC20/dpni20
	$ sudo chmod +s /DEC20/dpni20
```

After all that, you should have:
<sub>
```
	$ ls /DEC20
	boot.sav   dpni20  dptm03  flushed    kn10-kl     read20  README-MULTIUNIT-RP07  tapedd   uexbconv  wfconv
	dfkfb.ini  dprpxx  enaddr  klt20.ini  mtboot.sav  README  RH20.RP07.1            udlconv  vdkfmt    wxtest
```
</sub>

The RP07 disk is a 500MB drive and should be large enough for casual work.  If you need additional storage, you can add more RP07's and MOUNT them under TOPS-20 later.  See Harenstien's installation instructions `klh10/doc/install.txt` to add other devices.

### Configuring kl10h

We have a change to make to the klh10 configuration file, `/DEC20/klt20.ini`, in order for it to establish the network connection.

Recall the IP address you have given your DEC20.  On your Pi, edit the file `/DEC20/klt20.ini`, and change the device definition for "ni0" to the following (with your choice of IP addess):

```
	devdef ni0 564 ni20 ipaddr=192.168.1.60 ifc=tap0 ifmeth=tap.
```

We still have to make some changes in the TOPS-20 internal configuration files in order to make the nework connection, but we're finished with the Linux work on the Pi for now. 

### Testing the DEC20 System

> [!Note]
> **Up until this point, you could have done this work on your Raspberry Pi via SSH from a remote host.  But starting the DEC20 now will cause the network to disconnect your SSH connection.  So you'll need to log in on a native display on your Pi for the rest of this work.**

We can now boot your DECSYSTEM-20!  

Both Harrenstien's `klh10/doc/install.txt` and MRC's `/DEC20/README` give instructions on how to boot the DEC20.  If you have trouble with the steps below, refer to those files for more information.  The process below is modeled on those guides.

1. `$ cd /DEC20`
1. `$ sudo ./klt20`
1. At the prompt
			KLH10# ; Ready to GO</br>
			KLH10# [EOF on klt20.ini]</br>
			KLH10#</br>
type `GO`
1. In response to</br>
			BOOT\> </br>
just press the RETURN button.
1. In response to </br>
			Why reload?</br>
type `opr`
1. In response to </br>
			Run CHECKD?</br>
type `no`

The system will boot up and start its various internal processes.  If you scroll back through your screen, you should see something like this:
<sub>
```
	[dpni20: ifc "tap0" => ether f2:b:a4:9:c:a0]
	[dpni20:   VHOST 192.168.1.60]
	[dpni20: Enabled net.ipv4.conf.tap0.arp_accept]
	[KNILDR: Loading microcode version 1(172) into Ethernet channel 0]
```
</sub>

That's klh10 loading its network interface "device" and assigning it the IP address you gave it in `/DEC/klt20.ini`.

When those have finished, press CONTROL-C (`^C`) and TOPS-20 will respond with a command-line prompt, `@ `, and you can log in with operator credentials:

* @ login operator dec-20

where the password "dec-20", will not echo on the display.

You're now logged into the DEC20 as "operator".  

### Getting Comfortable

Many commands offer guidewords and command word completion, and most accept abbreviated commands.  "?" lists the alternatives at that point in a command, and "[ESC key]" offers command completion. You'll see that below, for example: "$$wor ?" shows what you can enter as allowed sizes for the account's working storage, and "$$wor inf[ESC]" completed to "infINITY".  Using those keys can help guide you through completing most commands.

Following MRC's advice, create a personal account for yourself and give it access to privileges.  Log in as OPERATOR, and then:
<sub>
```
	@enable
	$^Ecreate ps:<your username>  [that's a CONTROL-E key press to start]
	[New]
	$$wor infINITY
	$$perm infINITY
	$$maxIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES (ALLOWED) 1000
	$$wheel
	$$oper
	$$passWORD <your password here>
	$$ [press RETURN to execute the command]
	3-Nov-2025 12:24:56 ACJ: Create directory PS:<your username> with privileges by job 9,
	user OPERATOR, program CREATE, TTY5
	$
```
</sub>

Now `@logout[RETURN]`, press `^C` [CONTROL-C] to get an `@ ` prompt, and log in as yourself with your password.  Type `@ ENA` to make sure you can access operator privileges.  

The Panda system offers several text editors: EMACS, EDIT, and TECO.  If you use EDIT, remember to "eu" to exit ("exit and unnumber").  If you're familiar with EMACS, you'll find the version on DEC20 to be quite primitive, but it works.  The arrow keys don't function (use ^B, ^F, ^P, ^N) but it's usable.

You'll find it helpful to at least set your terminal characteristics at login time.  On the Pi, using its terminal program, terminal type "VT300-series" seems to work reasonably well for working with TOPS-20 (except that EMACS doesn't know about it, so you have to identify as VT102 to EMACS).

Using the editor of your choice (EMACS in my case):

```
	@ emacs login.cmd [tell emacs you're on a VT102]
	term vt300-series
	term width 80
	term len 24
	^x^s^x^c  [save file and exit]
	take login.cmd
```

Your DELETE key will now backspace-erase letters when you press delete.  On your next login, that file will be executed automatically.

You've now seen the login "beware" message, so we can eliminate it:

```
	@enable
	$conn ps:<system>
	$emacs beware-message.txt
	[delete text]
	^x^s^x^c
	$
```

Of course, you can replace the existing text there with another message if you'd prefer.

The Panda distribution includes some Linux-like programs that _generally_ work as expected, such as `ls`, `grep`, `mv`, `mkdir`, etc., with allowance for the different DEC20 syntax (e.g., `ps:<mydir.subdir>` for directory formats).  You can see a list of those Linux-like programs by typing `@ ls unix-sys:`.  If you're a regular Linux user, you'll likely find yourself surprised that when you accidently type `ls` you get a directory listing: that set of tools is why, since they are not native TOPS-20 commands.

### Configuring the DEC20 for Internet

You have to "enable" your privileges to edit some TOPS-20 system files.  

Following MRC's guidance in his "README", you'll need to edit these files to configure your DEC20 and set it up for Internet service.  MRC: "The format of most of these files should be obvious, but if you aren't sure please ask questions:"
<sub>
```
	SYSTEM:7-1-CONFIG.CMD      to set your timezone [NYC is +5]
	SYSTEM:HOSTS.TXT           to define your local host name and network
	SYSTEM:INTERNET.ADDRESS    to define (again!) your IP address -- must
	                            be the same as in klt20.ini.  Also define
	                            your netmask here as LOGICAL-HOST-MASK
	SYSTEM:INTERNET.GATEWAYS   to define your IP gateway
	SYSTEM:MONNAM.TXT          to define your system name
	DOMAIN:RESOLV.CONFIG       to define your DNS servers, your default
	                            domain (replacing MYDOMAIN.COM) and any
	                            users in addition to OPERATOR who can
	                            send control messages to the resolver.
```
</sub>

### Shutting Down

You need to have ENAbled operator privileges in order to shut the DEC20 down:

1. @ena
1. $^Ecease now [again, CONTROL-E keypress to start]
2. [confirm with a carriage return]
3. after "SHUTDOWN COMPLETE", type CONTROL-\ (hold down CONTROL and press the backslash key) to exit to the KLH10 command prompt
4. type "exit"
5. after CONFIRM, press "Y" and then the RETURN key, you'll exit back to the Linux command prompt.

## Testing TCP/IP Connectivity

Reboot your DEC20 system.  Type `^C` to get the command prompt. Log in as yourself.

Type:

* @ ftp <your Pi's host name>

There may be a delay of a minute or two, but then you should see:

```
	< (vsFTPd 3.0.5)
	Setting default transfer type to text.
	FTP>
```
showing that you can log in to your Pi account and transfer files.

From a different terminal session on your Pi, type:

* $ telnet dec20 (or whatever you named your DEC20 IP hostname)

Telnet will try to make the connection:
```
	Trying 192.168.1.60...
	Connected to dec20.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	
	HDTsKL, PANDA TOPS-20 Monitor 7.1(21733)-4
	@ 
```

Log in, then log out, and then, again into your second Pi terminal window type:
* $ ftp dec20
and you should see the ftp prompt from your DEC20:

```
	Connected to dec20.
	220 DEC20 FTP Server Process 5Z(40)-7 at Wed 5-Nov-2025 16:14-EST
	Name (dec20:hdtodd):
```

You now have TCP/IP connectivity between your Pi and your hosted DEC20.  The FTP syntax is archaic, but with "?" you can work through connecting and transferring files.

### Cleaning Up

During the boot process, you might have noticed:
<sub>
```
	SJ  0: 12:12:29          -- Structure Status Change Detected --
	SJ  0:                 Structure state for structure TOPS-20 is incorrect
	SJ  0:                   EXCLUSIVE/SHARED attribute set incorrectly
	SJ  0:                 Status of structure TOPS-20: is set:
	SJ  0:                 Domestic, Unregulated, Shared, Available, Dumpable
```
</sub>
That seems to reflect a disk structure status of MRC's TOPS-20 system disk, which appears to have the SHARED attribute set.  While the system resets it as it boots, you can fix it permanently with the following commands to `opr`, the operator's management program:

```
	@ ena
	$ opr
	OPR> set structure tops20: exclusive
	OPR> exit
	$ 
```
We also need to clean up any lost pages on the DEC20's virtual drive.

1. Reboot the system  **BUT ...**
1. At the "WHY RELOAD", type "SA" (we're going to run StandAlone to start)
1. At "RUN CHECKD?", type "Y" and let the CHECKD program check the systems disk for errors.  The only errors should be lost pages -- storage pages that had belonged to some file but were orphaned.  It's usually a small number of pages, but let's clean that up.
1. After CHECKD runs, it'll report something like "24 lost pages" and store that information in the file `PS:<OPERATOR>TOPS-20-LOST-PAGES.BIN` and then continue to reboot.
1. After the boot process has completed, log in and:

```
	@ ena
	$ CHECKD
	CHECKD>release TOPS-20:TOPS-20-LOST-PAGES.BIN.1 tops20:
	CHECKD>exit
```
You may need to do this occasionally as regular maintenance, particularly if you've had system crashes or inadvertently terminated the klh10 process when you rebooted your Pi.

## Using Magnetic Tape Images

I found it most convenient to move the magtape library to the `/DEC20` production directory on the Pi:

* $ sudo mv DEC20Sources/Tapes /DEC20

While klh10 supports the use of physical tape devices, you'll likely just use disk files that have been created to mimic the format of magnetic tapes such as those you might have stored in the `Tapes` directory.

TOPS20 uses the 'DUMPER' program to save/restore files and directories.  

> [!caution]
> **By default, the virtual magtape is mounted read-only**.

To mount a tape on a drive, use the 'devmount' directive in `/DEC20/klt20.ini':

```
	;THIS is how you define a read-only tape mount
	devmount mta0 Tapes/bb-h137f-bm.tap
```

That directive would tell klh10 to "mount" the DEC20 software distribution tape on device mta0:.  Once you've booted up and logged in, you would:

* @ assign mta0:

and then proceed with DUMPER to list tape contents (`PRINT`) or restore its contents to disk (`RESTORE`) [though that particular `bb-h137f-bm.tap` tape has a binary, non-DUMPER file at the beginning].

To mount a virtual magtape for writing (e.g., for backing up), in `/DEC20/klt20.ini` you'd use:
```
	;THIS is how you define a writeable tape mount
	devmount mta0 Tapes/Temp.tap rw
```

**where the file `Temp.tap` is empty or non-existent.**  klh10 won't let you write over an existing virtual tape file.  `@ assign mta0:` after you've logged in and then run DUMPER.

## Unresolved Issues

1. It's quite inconvenient that bringing up the DEC20 terminates the Pi's Internet service to the rest of the world.  It restores once the DEC20 has shut down, but it would be great to have full service to/from the Pi while the DEC20 is running and even better to have service to the DEC20 from any other host on your network.  If you figure out how to do that, please let me know the solution.
1. It's annoying that EMACS doesn't know how to drive a VT300-series terminal and requires a definition each time you start the editor.  
1. I have been unable to stop the klh10 program with CNTL-\\, use `devmount` to assign a different virtual tape to the drive, and continue.  It's not clear from Harrenstien's documentation whether it should be possible.  If you get it to work, please say how.
2. It appears to have been possible to run `/DEC10/klt20` without having root privileges by having set `dpni20` +s and owned by root, but that no longer works.  If you find a solution, please say how.

## Creating Your Own Systems Disk

If you want to create your own systems disk rather than use the Panda RH20, Harrenstien has instructions on how to do that in `~/DEC20Sources/klh10/run/klt20/README`.  He also provided the `.ini` and booting (`.sav`) programs to get you started.  But you'll need the Digital software distribution tapes to get started.  Download these tapes from the Trailing Edge site and follow the instructions Harrenstien provided.

Download at least these TOPS-20 7.0 Distribution from the Trailing Edge site:

# Wisdom from klh10's Creator

Harrenstien closed his "history.txt" notes with the following.  For those of us who managed DEC-10's and DEC20's that occupied a large room and consumed incredible amounts of power and cooling, this is very poignant.  Particularly when you boot up (the late) MRC's Panda system.

> I was going to close with the last paragraph, but realized there's one more thing I want to say.  It's just that, um, well, this will sound silly, but it feels so... weird? ... eerie?  ... just plain literally *mind-blowing* to watch this system boot up and run happily, utterly unaware that it's not on a real machine, or that anything odd happened since the last time it ran, or that its earthly incarnation of a noisy roomful of huge cabinets and washing machines is now entirely self-contained within a small innocuous pizza box holding up my ITS manuals.  Do systems have wathans?  I've gotten a bit more used to it, but every now and then I still sit back, realize once again what the hell is going on, and hold on to something while  the chills pass.  I didn't expect this at all.  A side effect of being imprinted at a tender young age, or something...
